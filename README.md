# Readable-code

Readable-code is a project made by Hsia. It's a challenge asigned by BECODE LIEGE code training center. I had been working on this on 16/03/2021 to learn about the teamworking pattern and consolidate our knowledges in the codes we've learned.

# The mission
Imagine: during our internship, we get handed an existing project to maintain.
we try to read into the project, but there's no readme scream, we see variables like $a or $dontChangeThis and the last developer with project knowledge just left.
we wouldn't wish that to anyone, would you? Now, let's see what we can do to prevent this from happening with a focus on readability!


# The languages used
- PHP
